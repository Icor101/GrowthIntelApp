# GrowthIntelApp

The app provides useful information pertaining to the growth/development of a child patient and lists abnormalities (if any) on the basis of inputs provided by a paediatrician. The appâ€™s front end was built using C# Winforms and the database side was handled using SQL and PL/SQL.

The app starts with a Login/Sign Up window:

After successful login the user can view the main app window which consists of two tabs:

- Report 
- Vaccine Tracker

The **'Report'** tab prompts the user to enter a bunch of details about the patient.

If the inputs are valid, the app generates a report showing a comparison of the growth metrics against the ideal standards using a histogram. The report also shows a list of abnnormalities (like "Short stature", "Overweight", "Underweight" etc) discovered on the basis of the inputs provided.

The '**Vaccine Tracker**' tab allows the paediatrician to update the database and keep track of a child's vaccination course against multiple diseases like BCG, Hepatitis B, DTP etc.
