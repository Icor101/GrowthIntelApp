# GrowthIntelApp

Paediatricians use growth charts to determine a childâ€™s measurements (like weight, height, head circumference) relative to other children of the same age. CDC growth charts are used to calculate the percentile (z-score) for distinct measurements of a child below the age of 20. These observations are helpful in determining abnormalities, irregular growth patterns and possible warning signals to ensure optimal health of a child. The aim of this application is to simplify this diagnostic procedure by automating the process of z-score calculation and measurement comparison against growth charts.

The app calculates the z-score of a patient using a PL/SQL procedure, which makes use of the relevant growth charts stored in the database, and then generates a health report of the child patient with graphical measurement comparison & a list of abnormalities. As an additional feature, this app can also help the doctor keep track of vaccination course of their young patients.

The app starts with a Login/Sign Up window:

After successful login the user can view the main app window which consists of two tabs:

- Report 
- Vaccine Tracker

The **'Report'** tab prompts the user to enter a bunch of details about the patient.

If the inputs are valid, the app generates a report showing a comparison of the growth metrics against the ideal standards using a histogram. The report also shows a list of abnnormalities (like "Short stature", "Overweight", "Underweight" etc) discovered on the basis of the provided inputs.

The '**Vaccine Tracker**' tab allows the paediatrician to update the database and keep track of a child's vaccination course against multiple diseases like BCG, Hepatitis B, DTP etc.
